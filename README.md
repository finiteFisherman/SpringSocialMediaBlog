#Social Media Blog API

##Project Overview
This social media application will be an api backend without a frontend. The app will have the ability to manage user accounts and messages that they submit to the application. Users will be able to see all of the messages posted to the site as well as the messages posted by a particular user. In either case, we require a backend which is able to deliver the data needed to display this information as well as process actions like logins, registrations, message creations, message updates, and message deletions.

##Responsibilities:
Using Javalin and JDBC, developed a messaging app backend. The backend featured necessary Messages and Account DAO and Service classes and a controller to handle endpoints. This backend was able to function and pass test cases for the following user stories:
•	Process new user registrations
•	process user logins
•	Create new messages
•	Retrieve all messages
•	Retrieve a message by ID
•	Delete a message by ID
•	Update a message by ID
•	Retrieve all message by user
 

##Environment:
Java, Javalin, JDBC
